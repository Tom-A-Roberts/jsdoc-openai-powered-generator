# JSDoc OpenAI-Powered Generator


This vs-code extension generate JSDOC comments using your OpenAI key, and a specified model. Specifically, if you select a function and activate the extension, it'll create a new JSDOC comment above the function, and call the OpenAI API.

It pre-prompts the model with the entire function and tells it to make a JSDOC.
